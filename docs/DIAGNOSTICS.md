# Bridge flight recorder

The recorder belongs to the OFXR OpenXR layer and is independent from game or
VR-mod logging. It is disabled by default.

Enable **Bridge flight recorder** from the tray before starting the game. Each
OpenXR process then creates a bounded file named
`ofxr-bridge-flight-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-pidNNNN.log`. Use **Open bridge logs** to
open its directory.

The log records layer negotiation, graphics binding, swapchain eligibility,
projection mapping, frame-generation stages, recovery events and potentially
blocked OpenXR call boundaries. An unmatched begin record can identify the
operation which did not return during a freeze.

For a compatibility report, reproduce the problem once and attach the newest
flight log. Also provide the game and version, VR mod, headset, OpenXR runtime,
GPU and driver, selected backend/options and exact reproduction steps. If no
log was created, state that explicitly: the layer may not have loaded or the
process may have stopped before recorder initialization.

The recorder does not capture video and is not a replacement for a native
crash dump. Game logs and crash dumps remain useful when available.
